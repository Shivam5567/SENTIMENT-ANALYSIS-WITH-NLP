DESCRIPTION:
This project performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression**.
The dataset contains text reviews labeled as positive or negative.
The preprocessing stage cleans the text by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation, making it suitable for vectorization.
Using **TF-IDF**, the text is transformed into numerical feature vectors that capture the importance of each word in relation to the dataset.
A Logistic Regression model is trained on these vectors to classify reviews based on sentiment.
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix, offering insights into prediction quality and potential improvements.
